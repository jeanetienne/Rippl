# Rippl

UI element showing a growing circle, reminiscent of a ripple in a pond.

A Rippl is a simple UIView sublcass which draws an ellipse (most probably a circle) within its frame and has 2 built-in animations. You can call an "impact ripple" to create an additional growing ellipse behind the original one, or you can call a "gain" animation that grows the original view according to the value of the gain.

## Features
Rippl is IBDesignable and IBInspectable, making it very easy to use in Interface Builder.

## Sample project
Clone this repo and run the project, it contains a sound recorder to help you visualise the "gain" animation. You can also trigger the "impact ripple" animation with a button.
