                       A Ripple is a simple UIView sublcass which draws an ellipse
                       (most probably a circle) within its frame and has 2 built-in
                       animations. You can call an "impact ripple" to create an
                       additional growing ellipse behinf the original one, or you
                       can call a "gain" animation that grows the original view
                       according to the value of the gain.
